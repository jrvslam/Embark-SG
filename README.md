## Inspiration
**The strive for excellence and desire to simplify services**
When we first sifted through the ICA and MOM websites, we were overwhelmed by the amount of information we had to process and filter. We think this is no easy feat for anyone unfamiliar with the topics. We believe that there is an easier way to do this. In our goal to help others, we have created **Embark-SG**.

## What it does
Embark-SG aims to give users a one-stop experience in finding all the information they need to get through the tedious task of preparing for a trip to Singapore. Embark-SG uses a questionnaire format to help users find the relevant information they need and organise it neatly in a checklist and roadmap. For returning Singaporeans, Embark-SG provides local news updates and keeps them in the loop as well as connected to the community.

## How we built it
We performed multiple user research, analysis, ideation, and created a high-fidelity prototype via Figma.

## Challenges we ran into
The initial design process was difficult as we started from scratch. In addition, we had to comb through multiple sources of information in order to determine the best way to present the questionnaire. Making the entire prototype cohesive was also a challenge as we wanted to stay clean and minimalistic while being innovative and informative.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We believe we created a comprehensive solution that will help struggling individuals when they are traveling to Singapore. As a product, we believe it has a solid foundation for future innovation.

## What we learned
We learnt the technical skills to analyse raw data and design effective solutions.

## What's next for Embark-SG
We plan to add multiple features where it is more personalised. We want to create a platform that ministries and statutory boards can integrate functions that will help users who are planning their journey to Singapore.
